## Known Issues

Please be aware that not all property-editors will work within Nested Content. The following property-editors are known to have compatibility issues:

* Checkbox List (default Umbraco core)
* Image Cropper (default Umbraco core)
* Macro Container (default Umbraco core)
* Radiobutton List (default Umbraco core)
* Repeatable Textstring (default Umbraco core) - this works in the back-office, but due to a bug in the value-converter it will produce additional blank entries
* Upload (default Umbraco core)
* Dropdown List Multiple (default Umbraco core)
